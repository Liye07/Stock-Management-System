# Stock Management System  

## Project Overview  
This is a **Stock Management System** built using **Python** as part of a university assignment. The system allows users to:  
- Add stocks along with their price.  
- Add stock items under a specific stock code.  
- View the complete stock list, including stock values.  

The program ensures data validation, preventing invalid entries such as exceeding stock limits or incorrect price values.  

## Features  
✔️ Add and store stocks with a maximum limit.  
✔️ Assign a stock price with validation to ensure correct input.  
✔️ Search for stocks using their names before adding stock items.  
✔️ Manage stock items under existing stocks.  
✔️ Display a structured stock list with total values.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** for logic implementation.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as functions and data validation.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository or download the script.  
2. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.  
3. Use the menu to add stock codes, assign stock items, and view the stock list.
