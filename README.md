# Stock Management System  

## Project Overview  
This is a **Stock Management System** built using **Python** as part of a university assignment. The system allows users to:  
- Add stocks along with their price.  
- Add stock items under a specific stock code.  
- View the complete stock list, including stock values.  

The program ensures data validation, preventing invalid entries such as exceeding stock limits or incorrect price values.
